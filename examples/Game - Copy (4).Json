   "Summary":"The island of Bombolia has been invaded! Bizarre creatures from a beached cargo ship are running wild and causing all sorts of havoc! Only the Super Sloth Bomber can save the day... Up, up and away! Super Sloth Bomber is a pixelart tour-de-force, sporting thousands of frames of animation that bring to life bizarre enemies and devious boss characters against which to test your mettle; powerups, environmental hazards, and a defiantly old-school soundtrack adding to the gleeful chaos of each level! Clear the island of Bombolia by blasting all the creatures to kingdom come! Skillfully pilot your balloon with the Arrow Keys (or AWSD keys) and press the Space Bar to drop your bombs, then wait for them to explode. Aim and timing is crucial and as you progress the enemies get tougher, faster and smarter - luckily you can upgrade your arsenal with different bomb types and powerups. Make sure to keep an eye on the radar telling you where enemies are too... and whatever you do, don't run out of bombs or time! Should you want to pause for whatever reason then push either Escape or P.	",
