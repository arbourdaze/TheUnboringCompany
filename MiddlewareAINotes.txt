Middleware Notes:

Collect past choices
Record personality

Regressions/Predictive Text Problem
	Past Choices + Current Preferences & Personality --> Activity Set
	OR/AND
	Past Choices + Current Preferences & Personality --> Discovery Search

HARDEST PART: Convert Activities/Search words into vector representation
	Word2Vec?

Use data to both perform searches and order discovery results
	Options:
		- Naive Bayes
		- Support Vector Machine/Support Vector Regression
		- Decision Tree
		- Rule Based (Maybe)
		- RNN For text generation


Possible Algorithm 1:
	- Convert Set of Search words to vectors using Word2Vec
	- Have AI map past choices, personality, current preferences to word vectors
	- Convert word vectors back to words
	- Search in watson
	- (Possible) Order results using AI also
	- Return Results

Possible Algorithm 2: (I like this better -Chris)
	- Search watson as we did before, but return all results
	- Use AI to map personality, past choices --> activity to select the best 10 activities across all categories
	- Return to user
