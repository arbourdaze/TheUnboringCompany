From left to right, you want to have your slat and pepper in one, flour in the second, beaten egg in the third and your fine breadcrumbs in the fourth. It's very simple...season the pieces of meat and dip them into the flour, shaking off any excess, then put them into the egg, dripping off any excess, and into the breadcrumbs, patting them over both sides and pressing down quite firmly. Gently shake off any excess and put the meat on a board or clean plate ready to be cooked.\r\n\r\nHeat a heavy frying pan, add a couple of good glugs of olive oil and, when it's good and hot, put both pieces of pork into the pan. Cook for 2 minutes or so, then carefully start to shake and agitate the pan to cover them in the hot oil. Turn the pork over and continue to cook for a couple of minutes until both sides are crisp and golden brown. Remove to a tray line with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Put a schnitzel on to each of your serving plates. Put a little pile of cornichon matchsticks and some watercress leaves on top and serve with a big lob of apple sauce, a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.", "waittime": 0, "comments": ""}, {"id": "49d9245db3d9b2b6415d86dd79ac7b8e", "result_metadata": {"score": 5.0123277}, "carbs": 0, "name": "Pot Roast Carbonnade", "source": "Melissa D'Arabian, FoodNetwork", "servings": 4, "calories": 0, "sugar": 0, "preptime": 0, "cooktime": 0, "tags": ["beef", "main"], "fiber": 0, "protein": 0, "satfat": 0, "fat": 0, "ingredients": ["1/2 pound bacon, cut into large lardons\r", "2 medium onions, sliced\r", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\r", "1 tablespoon vegetable oil\r", "1 1/2 pound beef chuck, cut into large cubes\r", "5 carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks\r", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour\r", "12 ounce beer (dark or light)\r", "6 prunes\r", "1 tablespoon dried thyme\r", "1 cup beef stock"], "extracted_metadata": {"sha1": "65d6cb0b09f1d1109a0deeff9b436d45facb3547", "filename": "recipe - Copy (30).json", "file_type": "json"}, "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.\r\n\r\nIn a large Dutch oven over medium-low heat, add the bacon and cook until it renders its fat and almost becomes crispy.
