	"Description": "You follow the stairs down, leaving what little light this island has outside.  A draft blows a door shut behind you.\nStraight ahead is a pitch black cell that could be as small as a closet or as large as a black hole -- you have no way of knowing its size.  You have no way of knowing whether you are alone in here.  And for a few moments of fumbling for the door, you have no way of knowing whether the way you are going is the way you came.\nThe darkness almost fills your lungs like drowning water.",
