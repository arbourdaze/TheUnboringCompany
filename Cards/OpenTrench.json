    "Description": "You peer down into the trench and quickly realize it is still in use.  Hundreds of pine boxes are stacked with indignity, and the stench is so powerful, you swoon and nearly fall in.\nYou wonder who is bringing all these bodies here.  Surely they're collected and ferried here from the morgues, prisons, nursing homes, underpasses and other most downtrodden places in the nearest city.  But what city is near this place?",
